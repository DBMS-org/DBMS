## 14. CONCLUSION

This document provides comprehensive descriptive use cases for the Drilling & Blasting Management System (DBMS). Each use case is detailed with:

- **Clear identification** with unique IDs
- **Actor definitions** specifying who interacts with the system
- **Preconditions** ensuring the system state is ready
- **Postconditions** defining the expected outcome
- **Basic flow** describing the normal sequence of steps
- **Exceptional flows** handling error conditions and invalid inputs
- **Alternate flows** providing alternative paths to achieve goals

### Coverage Summary:
- **26 detailed use cases** covering all major system functions
- **8 primary actor roles** with specific responsibilities
- **Complete traceability** to functional requirements
- **Real-world scenarios** based on actual implementation
- **Comprehensive error handling** for robust system behavior

### Next Steps:
1. Review use cases with stakeholders for accuracy
2. Validate against system implementation
3. Create UI/UX mockups aligned with use case flows
4. Develop test cases based on use case scenarios
5. Update use cases as system evolves
