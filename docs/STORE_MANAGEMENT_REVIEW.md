## Executive Summary

The Store Management module has been analyzed across all layers (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation). While the implementation follows Clean Architecture principles, there are **several issues, redundancies, and inconsistencies** that should be addressed.

**Progress Update**: We have successfully completed fourteen fixes:
- **1.1 - Duplicate Manager Information**: Removed redundant manager fields from Store entity
- **1.2 - Unused ExplosiveTypes Collection**: Removed dead code and simplified the domain model
- **1.4 - Missing RemoveManager Method**: Added RemoveManager method to Store entity
- **2.1 - Duplicate Validation**: Removed DataAnnotations and manual validation, kept only FluentValidation
- **2.2 - Service Comment Indicates Missing Feature**: Added manager removal logic using RemoveManager() domain method
- **2.3 - Inefficient Search Implementation**: Moved city filtering from in-memory to SQL query
- **2.4 - Utilization Calculated in Multiple Places**: Replaced duplicate calculations with domain method GetUtilizationRate()
- **3.1 - Duplicate Methods**: Deleted duplicate GetByIdWithDetailsAsync method
- **3.2 - Duplicate Manager Methods**: Deleted GetStoresByManagerAsync, kept singular GetStoreByManagerAsync
- **3.3 - NotImplementedException Methods**: Deleted orphaned license number methods that threw NotImplementedException
- **3.4 - Duplicate Exists Methods**: Deleted orphaned ExistsAsync, kept StoreExistsAsync
- **3.5 - Inefficient Low Capacity Query**: Replaced duplicate utilization calculation with domain method
- **4.1 - Request Model in Controller File**: Moved UpdateStoreStatusRequest from controller to Application DTOs
- **4.2 - Redundant Try-Catch Blocks**: Removed all try-catch blocks and logger dependency, letting GlobalExceptionMiddleware handle exceptions

### Severity Levels
- 🔴 **Critical**: Must fix - breaks functionality or violates architecture
- 🟠 **High**: Should fix - causes confusion, bugs, or maintenance issues
- 🟡 **Medium**: Nice to fix - code quality improvements
- 🟢 **Low**: Optional - minor improvements

---

## 1. Domain Layer Issues

### ✅ What's Good
- Rich domain model with encapsulation (private setters)
- Business logic in entities (validation, business rules)
- Domain events ready (inherits from `BaseAuditableEntity`)
- Good use of value objects and enums

### 🔴 Critical Issues

#### 1.1 Store Entity - Duplicate Manager Information ✅ **FIXED**
**Location**: `Domain/Entities/StoreManagement/Store.cs:15-17, 25, 29`
**Status**: ✅ **Completed on October 2, 2025**
**Migration**: `20251002095535_RemoveDuplicateManagerFieldsFromStore`

**Problem** (RESOLVED): Store has BOTH manager user relationship AND hardcoded manager fields:
```csharp
public string StoreManagerName { get; private set; } = string.Empty;      // REMOVED ✅
public string StoreManagerContact { get; private set; } = string.Empty;   // REMOVED ✅
public string StoreManagerEmail { get; private set; } = string.Empty;     // REMOVED ✅
public int? ManagerUserId { get; private set; }                           // KEPT ✅
public virtual User? ManagerUser { get; private set; }                    // KEPT ✅
```

**Why it was bad**:
- Data redundancy - manager info stored in TWO places
- Data inconsistency risk - what if manager's email changes in User table?
- Violates Single Source of Truth principle
- Extra maintenance burden

**Solution Implemented**:
✅ Removed duplicate fields from Store entity
✅ Updated constructor and methods to remove manager parameters
✅ Updated EF Core configuration
✅ Updated DTOs to use User relationship navigation properties
✅ Updated validators to remove manager field validations
✅ Updated AutoMapper to map from `ManagerUser` relationship
✅ Updated Application Service logic
✅ Created and applied database migration

**Result**:
Manager information now accessed via: `store.ManagerUser?.Name`, `store.ManagerUser?.Email.Value`, `store.ManagerUser?.OmanPhone`

---

#### 1.2 Store Entity - Unused ExplosiveTypes Collection ✅ **FIXED**
**Location**: `Domain/Entities/StoreManagement/Store.cs:10, 32, 97-108`
**Status**: ✅ **Completed on October 2, 2025**
**Migration**: `20251002102414_RemoveUnusedExplosiveTypesCollection`

**Problem** (RESOLVED): `ExplosiveTypesAvailable` collection was defined but:
- Never used in business logic
- Duplicate of `StoreInventory.ExplosiveType`
- Only used by Add/Remove methods (which were also unused)

```csharp
private readonly List<ExplosiveType> _explosiveTypesAvailable = new();  // REMOVED ✅
public virtual IReadOnlyCollection<ExplosiveType> ExplosiveTypesAvailable => ...  // REMOVED ✅

public void AddExplosiveType(ExplosiveType explosiveType) { ... }      // REMOVED ✅
public void RemoveExplosiveType(ExplosiveType explosiveType) { ... }   // REMOVED ✅
```

**Why it was bad**:
- Dead code cluttering the entity
- Confusion - which is the source of truth?
- `StoreInventory` already tracks explosive types

**Solution Implemented**:
✅ Removed `_explosiveTypesAvailable` list field
✅ Removed `ExplosiveTypesAvailable` public property
✅ Removed `AddExplosiveType()` method
✅ Removed `RemoveExplosiveType()` method
✅ Updated `StoreInventoryDomainService.cs` to use `Inventories` collection instead
✅ Created and applied database migration

**Result**:
Available explosive types now accessed via: `store.Inventories.Select(i => i.ExplosiveType).Distinct()`

---

#### 1.3 Store Entity - CurrentOccupancy is Redundant ✅ **FIXED**
**Location**: `Domain/Entities/StoreManagement/Store.cs:19, 110-123`
**Status**: ✅ **Completed on October 3, 2025**
**Migration**: `20251003031458_MakeCurrentOccupancyComputedProperty`

**Problem** (RESOLVED): `CurrentOccupancy` was stored but can be calculated from inventory:
```csharp
public decimal CurrentOccupancy { get; private set; }  // REMOVED ✅

public void UpdateOccupancy(decimal newOccupancy) { ... }  // REMOVED ✅
```

**Why it was bad**:
- Calculated value stored in database (denormalization without justification)
- Could become out of sync with actual inventory
- Extra update burden when inventory changes
- Manual update method prone to errors

**Solution Implemented**:
✅ Changed `CurrentOccupancy` to computed property
✅ Removed `UpdateOccupancy()` method
✅ Removed database column via migration
✅ Updated EF Core configuration to ignore computed property
✅ Occupancy now automatically calculated from inventory sum

**Result**:
```csharp
// Computed property - always in sync with inventory
public decimal CurrentOccupancy => Inventories?.Sum(i => i.Quantity) ?? 0;
```

---

### 🟠 High Priority Issues

#### 1.4 Missing RemoveManager Method ✅ **FIXED**
**Location**: `Domain/Entities/StoreManagement/Store.cs:80-83`
**Status**: ✅ **Completed on October 3, 2025**

**Problem** (RESOLVED): Can assign manager but can't remove:
```csharp
public void AssignManager(int managerUserId) { ... }  // Exists
// No RemoveManager() method!
```

**Impact**: Noted in Application layer - line 213-215

**Solution Implemented**:
✅ Added `RemoveManager()` method to Store entity
```csharp
public void RemoveManager()
{
    ManagerUserId = null;
}
```

**Result**: Stores can now properly remove managers through domain method instead of direct property manipulation

---

## 2. Application Layer Issues

### ✅ What's Good
- Result pattern for error handling
- FluentValidation integration
- Proper use of AutoMapper
- Logging throughout

### 🟠 High Priority Issues

#### 2.1 Duplicate Validation ✅ **FIXED**
**Location**: `Application/Services/StoreManagement/StoreApplicationService.cs:107-111` + Validators
**Status**: ✅ **Completed on October 3, 2025**

**Problem** (RESOLVED): Validation happened in THREE places:
1. DataAnnotations in DTO (`CreateStoreRequest.cs:7-39`) - REMOVED ✅
2. FluentValidation validators (`CreateStoreRequestValidator.cs`) - KEPT ✅
3. Manual validation in service (`StoreApplicationService.cs:107-128`) - REMOVED ✅

**Why it was bad**:
- Redundant code
- Inconsistent validation logic
- Hard to maintain

**Solution Implemented**:
✅ Removed all DataAnnotations from `CreateStoreRequest.cs`
✅ Removed all DataAnnotations from `UpdateStoreRequest.cs`
✅ Removed manual UserExists validation from `CreateStoreAsync` method
✅ Removed manual RegionExists validation from `CreateStoreAsync` method
✅ Removed manual UserExists validation from `UpdateStoreAsync` method
✅ Kept FluentValidation as the single source of validation truth

**Result**:
Validation now handled exclusively by FluentValidation validators, eliminating redundancy and ensuring consistency

---

#### 2.2 Service Comment Indicates Missing Feature ✅ **FIXED**
**Location**: `Application/Services/StoreManagement/StoreApplicationService.cs:176-183`
**Status**: ✅ **Completed on October 3, 2025**

**Problem** (RESOLVED): UpdateStoreAsync only handled manager assignment, not removal:
```csharp
// OLD CODE - only assigns manager, never removes
if (request.ManagerUserId.HasValue)
{
    store.AssignManager(request.ManagerUserId.Value);
}
// No else clause to handle removal!
```

**Why it was bad**:
- Incomplete feature - couldn't remove managers
- Required workaround or direct property manipulation
- Violated encapsulation

**Solution Implemented**:
✅ Added else clause to call `RemoveManager()` when ManagerUserId is null
✅ Now properly uses domain method instead of direct property manipulation
```csharp
if (request.ManagerUserId.HasValue)
{
    store.AssignManager(request.ManagerUserId.Value);
}
else
{
    store.RemoveManager();
}
```

**Result**:
Manager assignment and removal now properly handled through domain methods, maintaining encapsulation

---

#### 2.3 Inefficient Search Implementation ✅ **FIXED**
**Location**: `Application/Services/StoreManagement/StoreApplicationService.cs:249` + Repository
**Status**: ✅ **Completed on October 3, 2025**

**Problem** (RESOLVED): City filter was applied in-memory AFTER database query:
```csharp
// OLD CODE - inefficient
var stores = await _storeRepository.SearchAsync(storeName, null, null, storeStatus);  // Gets ALL stores

// Then filtered in C# (in-memory):
if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(city))
{
    stores = stores.Where(s => s.City.Contains(city, ...));  // In-memory! ❌
}
```

**Why it was bad**:
- Loaded unnecessary data from database
- Poor performance with large datasets
- Potential N+1 query issues

**Solution Implemented**:
✅ Added `city` parameter to `IStoreRepository.SearchAsync` interface
✅ Updated `StoreRepository.SearchAsync` to filter by city in SQL query
✅ Updated `StoreApplicationService.SearchStoresAsync` to pass city parameter to repository
✅ Removed in-memory city filtering

```csharp
// NEW CODE - efficient
var stores = await _storeRepository.SearchAsync(storeName, city, null, null, storeStatus);
// City filtering now happens in SQL via EF Core query ✅
```

**Result**:
City filtering now executed at database level using SQL WHERE clause, improving performance and reducing data transfer

---

#### 2.4 Utilization Calculated in Multiple Places ✅ **FIXED**
**Locations**: `StoreApplicationService.cs:334` + `StoreRepository.cs:195`
**Status**: ✅ **Completed on October 3, 2025**

**Problem** (RESOLVED): Same calculation logic was duplicated in multiple places:
```csharp
// OLD CODE - Service (line 340-341)
var totalUsedCapacity = store.Inventories?.Sum(i => i.Quantity) ?? 0;
var utilization = (decimal)totalUsedCapacity / store.StorageCapacity * 100;

// OLD CODE - Repository (line 195-196)
var totalUsedCapacity = store.Inventories?.Sum(i => i.Quantity) ?? 0;
return (decimal)totalUsedCapacity / store.StorageCapacity * 100;
```

**Why it was bad**:
- Code duplication violates DRY principle
- Domain logic leaked into Application and Infrastructure layers
- Difficult to maintain - changes need to be made in multiple places
- Store entity already has `GetUtilizationRate()` method

**Solution Implemented**:
✅ Replaced duplicate calculation in `StoreApplicationService.GetStoreUtilizationAsync` with domain method call
✅ Replaced duplicate calculation in `StoreRepository.GetStoreUtilizationAsync` with domain method call
✅ Removed unnecessary validation (domain method handles edge cases)

```csharp
// NEW CODE - using domain method
var utilization = store.GetUtilizationRate();
```

**Note**: The calculation in `GetStoreStatisticsAsync` (line 375-377) is for **aggregate statistics** across all stores, not individual store utilization, so it remains unchanged as it serves a different purpose.

**Result**:
Utilization calculation now centralized in domain entity, following Clean Architecture principles and DRY

---

### 🟡 Medium Priority Issues

#### 2.5 Unnecessary DTO Fields
**Location**: `Application/DTOs/StoreManagement/StoreDto.cs:19-20, 25-26`

```csharp
public DateTime CreatedAt { get; set; }       // Audit field - needed in UI?
public DateTime UpdatedAt { get; set; }       // Audit field - needed in UI?
public int InventoryItemsCount { get; set; }  // Calculated - could be on-demand
public decimal UtilizationPercentage { get; set; }  // Calculated - duplicates method
```

**Recommendation**: Remove if not used in UI, or make them nullable/optional

---

## 3. Infrastructure Layer Issues

### ✅ What's Good
- Proper use of EF Core Include for eager loading
- Consistent error handling with logging
- Async/await throughout

### 🔴 Critical Issues

#### 3.1 Duplicate Methods ✅ **FIXED**
**Location**: `Infrastructure/Repositories/StoreManagement/StoreRepository.cs:38-53`
**Status**: ✅ **Completed on October 3, 2025**

**Problem** (RESOLVED): Two methods did the EXACT same thing:
```csharp
// GetByIdAsync
public async Task<Store?> GetByIdAsync(int id)
{
    return await _context.Stores
        .Include(s => s.Region)
        .Include(s => s.ManagerUser)
        .Include(s => s.Inventories)
        .FirstOrDefaultAsync(s => s.Id == id);
}

// GetByIdWithDetailsAsync - IDENTICAL! (DELETED ✅)
public async Task<Store?> GetByIdWithDetailsAsync(int id)
{
    return await _context.Stores
        .Include(s => s.Region)
        .Include(s => s.ManagerUser)
        .Include(s => s.Inventories)
        .FirstOrDefaultAsync(s => s.Id == id);
}
```

**Why it was bad**:
- 100% duplicate code - exact same implementation
- Confusing naming - both methods did the same thing
- Maintenance burden - changes needed in two places
- Violates DRY principle

**Solution Implemented**:
✅ Deleted `GetByIdWithDetailsAsync` from `StoreRepository`
✅ Removed method signature from `IStoreRepository` interface
✅ Replaced all 3 usages in `StoreApplicationService` with `GetByIdAsync`

**Result**:
Single method `GetByIdAsync` now used consistently throughout the codebase

---

#### 3.2 Duplicate Manager Methods ✅ **FIXED**
**Location**: `Infrastructure/Repositories/StoreManagement/StoreRepository.cs:133-148`
**Status**: ✅ **Completed on October 3, 2025**

**Problem** (RESOLVED): Two methods for manager lookup with nearly identical implementation:
```csharp
// GetStoresByManagerAsync - returns collection (DELETED ✅)
public async Task<IEnumerable<Store>> GetStoresByManagerAsync(int managerUserId)
{
    return await _context.Stores
        .Where(s => s.ManagerUserId == managerUserId)
        .Include(s => s.Region)
        .Include(s => s.ManagerUser)
        .ToListAsync();  // Returns collection
}

// GetStoreByManagerAsync - returns single (KEPT ✅)
public async Task<Store?> GetStoreByManagerAsync(int managerUserId)
{
    return await _context.Stores
        .Where(s => s.ManagerUserId == managerUserId)
        .Include(s => s.Region)
        .Include(s => s.ManagerUser)
        .FirstOrDefaultAsync();  // Returns single
}
```

**Why it was bad**:
- Business rule: One manager = one store (1:1 relationship)
- Service layer was using plural version then calling `.FirstOrDefault()` on result
- Inefficient - loads collection when only need single item
- Confusing naming - plural implies multiple stores per manager

**Solution Implemented**:
✅ Updated `StoreApplicationService.GetStoreByManagerAsync` to use singular method
✅ Removed unnecessary `.FirstOrDefault()` call in service
✅ Deleted `GetStoresByManagerAsync` from `StoreRepository`
✅ Removed method signature from `IStoreRepository` interface

**Result**:
Single method `GetStoreByManagerAsync` now used consistently, matching 1:1 business rule

---

#### 3.3 NotImplementedException Methods ✅ **FIXED**
**Location**: `Infrastructure/Repositories/StoreManagement/StoreRepository.cs:203-231`
**Status**: ✅ **Completed on October 3, 2025**

**Problem** (RESOLVED): Orphaned methods that threw `NotImplementedException`:
```csharp
// GetByLicenseNumberAsync (DELETED ✅)
public async Task<Store?> GetByLicenseNumberAsync(string licenseNumber)
{
    try
    {
        // Since Store entity doesn't have LicenseNumber property, this method should be removed
        // or the Store entity should be updated to include LicenseNumber
        throw new NotImplementedException("LicenseNumber property does not exist in Store entity");
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        _logger.LogError(ex, "Error getting store by license number {LicenseNumber} from database", licenseNumber);
        throw;
    }
}

// IsLicenseNumberUniqueAsync (DELETED ✅)
public async Task<bool> IsLicenseNumberUniqueAsync(string licenseNumber, int? excludeStoreId = null)
{
    try
    {
        // Since Store entity doesn't have LicenseNumber property, this method should be removed
        // or the Store entity should be updated to include LicenseNumber
        throw new NotImplementedException("LicenseNumber property does not exist in Store entity");
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        _logger.LogError(ex, "Error checking license number uniqueness for {LicenseNumber}", licenseNumber);
        throw;
    }
}
```

**Why it was bad**:
- Dead code that couldn't be called without throwing exception
- Confusing to developers - methods exist but don't work
- Not in interface (orphaned implementation methods)
- 29 lines of useless code

**Solution Implemented**:
✅ Verified methods are not used anywhere in codebase
✅ Deleted `GetByLicenseNumberAsync` method entirely (14 lines)
✅ Deleted `IsLicenseNumberUniqueAsync` method entirely (15 lines)

**Result**:
Removed 29 lines of dead code that only threw exceptions, cleaning up the repository

---

#### 3.4 Duplicate Exists Methods ✅ **FIXED**
**Location**: `Infrastructure/Repositories/StoreManagement/StoreRepository.cs:103-114`
**Status**: ✅ **Completed on October 3, 2025**

**Problem** (RESOLVED): Two methods doing the exact same thing:
```csharp
// ExistsAsync - orphaned, not in interface (DELETED ✅)
public async Task<bool> ExistsAsync(int id)
{
    try
    {
        return await _context.Stores.AnyAsync(s => s.Id == id);
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        _logger.LogError(ex, "Error checking if store {StoreId} exists in database", id);
        throw;
    }
}

// StoreExistsAsync - in interface (KEPT ✅)
public async Task<bool> StoreExistsAsync(int id)
{
    try
    {
        return await _context.Stores.AnyAsync(s => s.Id == id);
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        _logger.LogError(ex, "Error checking if store {StoreId} exists in database", id);
        throw;
    }
}
```

**Why it was bad**:
- 100% duplicate code - identical implementation
- `ExistsAsync` was not in interface (orphaned method)
- Neither method was being used anywhere
- Confusing to have two methods with same functionality

**Solution Implemented**:
✅ Verified neither method is currently used in codebase
✅ Deleted `ExistsAsync` orphaned method (12 lines)
✅ Kept `StoreExistsAsync` which is in the interface

**Result**:
Single method `StoreExistsAsync` available for future use, matching interface contract

---

### 🟠 High Priority Issues

#### 3.5 Inefficient Low Capacity Query ✅ **FIXED**
**Location**: `Infrastructure/Repositories/StoreManagement/StoreRepository.cs:205-222`
**Status**: ✅ **Completed on October 3, 2025**

**Problem** (RESOLVED): Duplicated utilization calculation logic in repository:
```csharp
// OLD CODE - duplicate calculation logic
var stores = await _context.Stores
    .Include(s => s.Inventories)
    .Where(s => s.Status == StoreStatus.Operational)
    .ToListAsync();

return stores.Where(s => {
    var totalUsed = s.Inventories.Sum(i => i.Quantity);  // Duplicate!
    var utilizationPercentage = s.StorageCapacity > 0 ? totalUsed / s.StorageCapacity : 0;  // Duplicate!
    return utilizationPercentage >= thresholdPercentage;
});
```

**Why it was bad**:
- Duplicated utilization calculation logic (same as in domain entity)
- Violates DRY principle
- Domain logic leaked into infrastructure layer
- Still loads all operational stores (EF Core limitation)

**Solution Implemented**:
✅ Replaced duplicate calculation with domain method call
✅ Simplified filtering logic from 4 lines to 1 line
✅ Added explanatory comment about EF Core limitation

```csharp
// NEW CODE - using domain method
var stores = await _context.Stores
    .Include(s => s.Inventories)
    .Where(s => s.Status == StoreStatus.Operational)
    .ToListAsync();

// Note: Must filter in-memory as EF Core cannot translate GetUtilizationRate() to SQL
return stores.Where(s => s.GetUtilizationRate() >= thresholdPercentage);
```

**Note**: In-memory filtering is still required because EF Core cannot translate the domain method `GetUtilizationRate()` to SQL. However, we've eliminated code duplication and now use the domain entity's method for consistency.

**Result**:
Utilization calculation centralized in domain entity, following Clean Architecture principles

---

#### 3.6 Wrong Utilization Calculation
**Location**: `Infrastructure/Repositories/StoreManagement/StoreRepository.cs:399-410`

**Problem**: Uses `StoreInventories` table directly instead of store relationship:
```csharp
public async Task<decimal> GetTotalCurrentOccupancyAsync()
{
    return await _context.StoreInventories.SumAsync(i => i.Quantity);  // WRONG!
}
```

**Why it's bad**:
- Bypasses Store aggregate
- Couples repository to unrelated table
- Doesn't consider store status (includes decommissioned stores)

**Recommendation**:
```csharp
public async Task<decimal> GetTotalCurrentOccupancyAsync()
{
    return await _context.Stores
        .Where(s => s.Status == StoreStatus.Operational)
        .SelectMany(s => s.Inventories)
        .SumAsync(i => i.Quantity);
}
```

## 4. Presentation Layer Issues

### ✅ What's Good
- Consistent error handling
- Authorization properly configured
- XML documentation comments
- RESTful API design

### 🟠 High Priority Issues

#### 4.1 Request Model in Controller File ✅ **FIXED**
**Location**: `Presentation/API/Controllers/StoreManagement/StoreManagementController.cs:317-320`
**Status**: ✅ **Completed on October 3, 2025**

**Problem** (RESOLVED): DTO was defined inside controller file:
```csharp
public class UpdateStoreStatusRequest  // Was in controller file!
{
    public StoreStatus Status { get; set; }
}
```

**Why it was bad**:
- Violated separation of concerns
- Not in Application layer where it belongs
- Couldn't be reused or validated

**Solution Implemented**:
✅ Created new file `Application/DTOs/StoreManagement/UpdateStoreStatusRequest.cs`
✅ Moved class definition to proper location in Application layer
✅ Removed class from controller file
✅ Build verified successfully with 0 errors

---

#### 4.2 Redundant Try-Catch Blocks ✅ **FIXED**
**Location**: Throughout `StoreManagementController.cs`
**Status**: ✅ **Completed on October 3, 2025**

**Problem** (RESOLVED): Every method had identical try-catch:
```csharp
try { ... }
catch (Exception ex)
{
    _logger.LogError(ex, "Error occurred while...");
    return StatusCode(500, "An error occurred while processing your request");
}
```

**Why it was bad**:
- `GlobalExceptionMiddleware` already handles all exceptions
- Duplicate error handling logic
- Unnecessary boilerplate code
- Extra logger dependency not needed

**Solution Implemented**:
✅ Removed all try-catch blocks from all controller methods
✅ Removed ILogger dependency from constructor
✅ Let GlobalExceptionMiddleware handle all exceptions centrally
✅ Build verified successfully with 0 errors
✅ Reduced code from 313 lines to 221 lines

---

## 5. Cross-Cutting Issues

### 🟡 Medium Priority

#### 5.1 Inconsistent Role Names
**Locations**: Multiple

**Problem**:
- `Program.cs:11` uses `ExplosiveManager`
- `StoreManagementController.cs:77` uses `Explosive Manager` (with space)
- Database has `Explosive Manager` (ID: 5)

**Recommendation**: Standardize to match database seeded values

---

#### 5.2 Missing Validators
**Location**: `Application/Validators/StoreManagement/`

**Problem**: No validator for `UpdateStoreStatusRequest`

**Recommendation**: Create `UpdateStoreStatusRequestValidator.cs`

---
