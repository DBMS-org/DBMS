# Application Layer ‚Äì Design & Guidelines

## Purpose
The **Application** layer is the _use-case orchestration_ layer. It coordinates domain objects, applies business workflows, and handles cross-cutting concerns like security, validation, and logging. It exposes **interfaces** that the Infrastructure & Presentation layers rely on. It must remain free of infrastructure details such as Entity Framework Core or ASP.NET.

```
Presentation ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ> Application ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ> Domain
             ‚îÇ               ‚îî‚îÄ> (only abstractions pointing outward)
Infrastructure ‚îò
```

---

## 1. Dependency Rules
1. **May reference:** `Domain` and `Microsoft.Extensions.*` abstractions (logging, caching, options).
2. **Must not reference:** `Infrastructure`, EF-Core, ASP.NET packages, or any concrete database/email/IO classes.
3. **DTOs are for external boundaries only** ‚Äì do not use them internally within application services or pass them to the Domain layer.

> _Note_: The project file currently honours rule #1 ‚Äì keep it that way.

---

## 2. Building Blocks
| Concept | Guidelines |
|---------|------------|
| **Interface** | Declares behaviour needed by the Application layer (`IProjectRepository`, `IPasswordService`). These are implemented in the `Infrastructure` project. |
| **Application Service** | Orchestrates a complete _use-case_ (`ProjectApplicationService`). It should be thin (~ ‚â§ 400 LOC) and focused on coordinating domain entities and core services. |
| **DTO / Request** | Shapes data for controllers/UI; hides sensitive fields; aggregates info from multiple entities. All incoming requests must have a dedicated request DTO. |
| **Core Service** | A cross-cutting concern implemented as a service (`IValidationService`, `IStructuredLogger`, `ICacheService`). These are defined in `Application` and implemented in `Infrastructure`. |
| **Validator** | A `FluentValidation` class for each request DTO that performs input validation. |

---

## 3. Core Services & Patterns

The application layer relies on a set of standardized services to handle cross-cutting concerns. All application services **must** use these services where appropriate.

| Service | Interface | Purpose & Usage |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Validation** | `IValidationService` | Centralized, synchronous/asynchronous validation of request DTOs. **Must** be the first step in any command-based application service method. Throws `ValidationException`. |
| **Logging** | `IStructuredLogger<T>` | Standardized structured logging with correlation IDs and operation scopes. Replaces `ILogger<T>` for all application services. **Must** be used for all logging. |
| **Caching** | `ICacheService` | In-memory caching for frequently accessed, slow-changing data (e.g., lists of projects, users). Use for read-heavy operations. |
| **Error Handling** | `Result<T>` | All methods that can fail **must** return a `Result<T>` object. This provides a consistent success/failure structure with detailed error messages. Do not use custom response objects. |
| **Exception Handling** | Custom Exceptions | Catch specific exceptions (`DbException`, `ValidationException`) and wrap them in a `Result.Failure`. Avoid catching generic `Exception` unless absolutely necessary. |
| **Performance** | `IPerformanceMonitor` | Used via middleware to automatically track and log the performance of all HTTP requests. Can be injected directly to measure specific long-running operations. |
| **Resource Management**| `ResourceManager` | Provides helpers for timeouts, `CancellationToken` management, and batch processing for long-running or bulk operations (e.g., CSV imports, bulk deletes). |

---

## 4. Modelling Principles
1. **Single Responsibility:** 1 service == 1 cohesive set of use-cases. If it grows beyond ~400 LOC or 10 methods, split it.
2. **Open/Closed via Interfaces:** The application depends _only_ on abstractions (`IUserRepository`, `IEmailService`).
3. **Asynchronous All The Way:** All repository and service methods must be `Task`-based.
4. **Centralized Validation:** Every public, command-executing method in an application service must begin with a call to `_validationService.ValidateAsync(request)`.
5. **Structured Logging Only:** All logging must go through `IStructuredLogger<T>`. Wrap method logic in `using var operation = _logger.BeginOperation(...)` to create a performance and contextual scope. Use specific logging methods like `LogDataAccessError` or `LogValidationFailure`.
6. **Consistent Error Handling:** Never throw exceptions directly from a service method. Instead, catch specific exceptions, log them, and return `Result.Failure()`.
7. **Strategic Caching:** Apply caching via `ICacheService` on read-heavy, high-latency methods that return data that does not change frequently. Invalidate the cache on CUD (Create/Update/Delete) operations.
8. **Unit-Testable:** Services must be testable with mocked dependencies. Avoid static calls.

## 5. Implementation Templates
### 5.1 Application Service Method
```csharp
public async Task<Result<UserDto>> CreateUserAsync(CreateUserRequest request)
{
    // 1. Use structured logger to create an operation scope for context and performance tracking.
    using var operation = _logger.BeginOperation("CreateUser", new { Email = request.Email, Role = request.Role });
    try
    {
        // 2. Validate the incoming request immediately.
        var validationResult = await _validationService.ValidateAsync(request);
        if (validationResult.IsFailure)
        {
            _logger.LogValidationFailure("User", validationResult.Errors, new { Email = request.Email });
            return Result.Failure<UserDto>(validationResult.Errors);
        }

        // 3. Coordinate domain entities and repositories.
        var existingUser = await _userRepository.ExistsByNameOrEmailAsync(request.Name, request.Email);
        if (existingUser)
        {
            _logger.LogBusinessWarning("User creation failed - user already exists", new { Email = request.Email });
            return Result.Failure<UserDto>(ErrorCodes.Messages.UserAlreadyExists(request.Email));
        }
        
        // ... business logic ...

        var createdUser = await _userRepository.CreateAsync(user);

        // 4. Invalidate cache if necessary.
        _cacheService.Remove(AllUsersCacheKey);
        
        _logger.LogOperationSuccess("CreateUser", new { UserId = createdUser.Id });
        return Result.Success(MapToDto(createdUser));
    }
    // 5. Catch specific exceptions and return a Failure Result.
    catch (DbException ex)
    {
        _logger.LogDataAccessError("CreateUser", ex, new { Email = request.Email });
        return Result.Failure<UserDto>("Database error occurred while creating user");
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        _logger.LogUnexpectedError("CreateUser", ex, new { Email = request.Email });
        return Result.Failure<UserDto>(ErrorCodes.Messages.InternalError);
    }
}
```

## 7. Checklist for a New Use-Case
- [ ] Do we already have a service that covers this use-case? If yes, extend carefully; else create a new `*ApplicationService`.
- [ ] Add or reuse repository/interface abstractions. **Never call EF-Core directly**.
- [ ] **Inject and use core services**: `IValidationService`, `IStructuredLogger`, and `ICacheService` where applicable.
- [ ] Create a `FluentValidation` validator for the request DTO.
- [ ] Wrap all method logic in a `try-catch` block and an `IStructuredLogger` operation scope.
- [ ] Return a `Result<T>` for all outcomes.
- [ ] Invalidate the appropriate cache keys on any CUD operation.
- [ ] Write/extend unit tests with mocked dependencies.
